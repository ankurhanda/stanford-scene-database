
---- Scene File Format

The scene file format is meant to be very easy to parse ASCII.
For completeness we document it here; see Scene.cpp for a sample parser, and databaseSample\scenes\sceneTest.txt for a sample scene.

The first three lines are:
StanfordSceneDatabase
version <major version>.<minor version>
modelCount <N>

Then N "newModel X Y" commands follow. X is the model index and Y is the model ID. This model ID is used to refer to
models in the field and model folders. It is also used by Google 3D Warehouse, using the "mid" tag, for example:
http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=27cbe370f005ea9ef0524a49202e8ac9

All lines after a "newModel" line refer to the most recent "newModel". The possible fields are:

"parentIndex X": X is the model index of this objects parent. -1 if this model is the root node.

"children <list of integers>": the model indices of all the children of this node. Just "children" if the model has no children.

The parent contact information is encoded in two redundant ways: as an absolute position (parentContactPosition) and normal (parentContactNormal), and as an index into the parent's triangle list.

"parentContactPosition X Y Z": the coordinates of the location on the parent model where this object is attached.
"parentContactNormal X Y Z": the surface normal of the location on the parent model where this object is attached.

"parentMaterialGroupIndex X": the index of the material group in the parent model's obj file that this object is attached to.
"parentTriangleIndex X": the index of the triangle within the material group specified in parentMaterialGroupIndex that this object is attached to.
parentUV X Y: the UV coordinates in the triangle referred to by parentMaterialGroupIndex and parentTriangleIndex.

"parentOffset X Y Z": an additional translation offset specified by the artist relative to parentContactPosition.
                      This is (0, 0, 0) for almost all objects; it is non-zero for floating or hovering objects.

"scale X": the uniform scale applied to this object relative to the model's local coordinate frame.

"transform <list of 16 floats>": The matrix transform from the local coordinate frame specified in the model's
								 *.obj to the world coordinates of the scene.

scale, parentContactPosition, parentContactNormal, and parentOffset are not needed to just render the scene; the "transform" field already incorporates these terms.
